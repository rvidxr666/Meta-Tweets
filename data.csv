Amid privacy scandals and controversy, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed.

Facebook, now under Meta, is undergoing a serious rebranding - most noticeably the incorporation of a future ""Metaverse."" This Metaverse includes spaces to work, collaborate and interact with others as well as a gaming platform reminiscent of Microsoft's failed.

It is clear that Zuckerberg is aware of the disdain people have toward the privacy violations of Facebook - throughout the video, he emphasizes the importance of ensuring privacy from the early stages of the Metaverse.

Zuckerberg's rebranding of Facebook could be an attempt to hide the baggage which comes with the name.

""As long as Facebook is operating in the shadows, hiding its research from public scrutiny, it is unaccountable. Until the incentives change, Facebook will not change,"" Facebook's whistleblower Frances Haugen stated.

Zuckerberg argues the Meta platform is designed for a distant future, but professional mockups make the usability of the software look clunky and awkward.

The question is if Zuckerberg's attempt to distract from Facebook's many affairs will be effective in keeping Facebook as unregulated as it is now.",https://dailyillini.com/opinions-stories/2021/11/18/meta-facebook-launch/

You have to hand it to Mark Zuckerberg: He certainly doesn't shy away from embarrassing himself - witness his cringeworthy video announcement to rebrand Facebook as Meta.

If we're being kind, Zuckerberg's show could be considered an ambitious vision if it wasn't for the fact that the company currently has enough problems on its hands that neither a new name nor virtual reality can solve.

For weeks, media outlets have been publishing internal documents under the name ""Facebook Papers,"" many of which originated with former company employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen.

These documents reveal a world that has nothing whatsoever to do with Zuckerberg's cozy visions.

Facebook does far too little to curb hate speech and conspiracy narratives.

Zuckerberg's calculation is that the overall corporation will garner a better image if Facebook is just a part of the whole.

Last week, Facebook Inc. announced its new corporate name, Meta, along with a new logo as part of the company's strategic shift toward focusing on the metaverse.

The public's initial reaction to the rebrand is less than enthusiastic, according to new data from Morning Consult.

A plurality of Americans said they have an unfavorable opinion of the new name.

Meta's new logo received a slightly less chilly reception, with respondents more evenly split on the warped infinity symbol.

That the new corporate name is meant to better ""Reflect who we are and the future we hope to build,"" a reference to his aspirations of building a metaverse, which he describes as ""An embodied internet where you're in the experience, not just looking at it.""

0,The expert's view- Facebook's move to Meta - 2021 - Articles,"Transform Magazine: The Expert'S View- Facebook'S Move To Meta
At the annual Facebook Connect conference, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook group's official rebrand to Meta, which will focus on bringing the metaverse to life and help people connect.

""That said, the execution of his vision has already fallen somewhat flat. An opportunity to be distinctive has been lost in the desire to retain links to Facebook through a similar colour palette, whilst the typography is reminiscent of early 2000s phone companies and feels a little generic. Of course, the rebrand also comes at a pivotal time for the company, currently embattled by increasing scrutiny from Congress. As a move to shift focus away from the ills of Facebook of old, the rebrand has its work cut out for it - and, on first review, it may struggle to live up to the task.""

""Facebook's rebrand to Meta signals a move to simultaneously overcome its current struggles and define a new growth opportunity. The shifting of its focus towards the metaverse and goal to make AR and VR-enabled experiences part of""the next generation of online social experiences"" has been well publicised and is indicative of how digital experience is evolving and touching more of our everyday lives"".

""The renaming of Facebook's parent company to Meta changes nothing for them, especially not the public perception of Facebook as a force for chaos, misinformation, and privacy violation. Mark Zuckerberg, a simulacrum of a human being, proposes that we will join his online environment called the""metaverse"", presumably as an escape from the dystopian society that Facebook has helped create.

""While it would be easy to see this recent move from Facebook as a smoke screen to throw people off negative press, it's short-sighted to look at the launch of Meta through such a one dimensional lens. A rebrand fools no-one when you are dealing with a crisis and Facebook will know this.""

The reality is that this move has been on the cards for a very long time as Facebook transitions its focus from platform to medium.

Alex Marshall, director of creative and strategy, Starts With A. ""Whilst the new name has already been widely ridiculed, this will likely be a successful move for Facebook. Zuckerberg has a clear vision and the Facebook name will constrain these ambitions. It makes commercial sense and already the share price has increased as a result. By moving to Meta, a clear and strong identity, the company can travel in the direction of the future platforms it wants to build. Yes, this might be another Google/Alphabet, but the strategy and reasoning behind this rebrand is much stronger. By 2031 I doubt that Gen Alpha will even be aware that Facebook used to be the parent brand.""",https://www.transformmagazine.net/articles/2021/the-experts-view-facebooks-move-to-meta/

The metaverse is not yet a reality, but it could be the next evolution of the internet.

If you're interested in technology, you've probably heard the buzzword of the moment - ""Metaverse."" The hype around this term may have reached its zenith Thursday, when Facebook announced that it was renaming its portfolio of companies 'Meta' to align its businesses with its ambition to build the metaverse.

The metaverse doesn't exist - at least not yet.

Just as you can't invest in the internet too, can you not identify the metaverse as a unique product, technology or service.

Central to the concept of the metaverse is the idea that virtual, 3D environments that are accessible and interactive in real time will become the transformative medium for social and business engagement.

The metaverse is also expected to have a strong connection with the real-world economy - and eventually become an extension of it.

Indiana University's Filippo Menczer, who studies the spread of information and misinformation in social networks, explains that engagement plays into people's tendency to favor posts that seem popular.

Some of the most disturbing revelations concern the harm Meta's Instagram social media platform causes adolescents, particularly teen girls.

The company has provided research that shows that its platforms do not cause harm in the way many researchers describe, and claims that the overall picture from all research on harm is unclear.

Despite substantial efforts to track misinformation on social media, it's impossible to know the scope of the problem without knowing the number of overall posts social media users see each day.

A federal judge says the US Federal Trade Commission can proceed with an antitrust lawsuit against Meta, formerly known as Facebook, after dismissing the suit last year.

District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg said in an opinion released today that the FTC's first complaint had ""Stumbled out of the starting blocks."" But a revised version, Boasberg said, makes the same arguments with facts that are ""Far more robust and detailed than before."" As a result, he's denying Meta's motion to dismiss and allowing the case to proceed, although he states that the agency ""May well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations.""

Throughout the case, the FTC has alleged that Meta holds an unlawful monopoly in personal social networking services and maintained it by acquiring the competitors Instagram and WhatsApp.

Today's opinion says the agency has reasonably backed that allegation up with data about Meta's market power, although like before, Boasberg held back on approving allegations involving older Meta interoperability policies.

The FTC suit against Meta is one of several US government efforts to curtail the monopoly power of major tech companies, including a Department of Justice lawsuit against Google proceeding under antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter.

Today's decision reverses a significant blow that Boasberg dealt the FTC in June, when he said the complaint contained ""Nothing"" proving Meta's monopoly power except for the ""Naked allegation"" that it held a dominant share of personal social networking services.

Facebook owner Meta Platforms said on Thursday it would ""Assess the feasibility"" of commissioning an independent human rights assessment into its work in Ethiopia, after its oversight board recommended a review of how Facebook and Instagram have been used to spread content that heightens the risk of violence there.

Meta has been under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over user safety and its handling of abuses on its platforms across the world, particularly after whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that showed the company's struggles in policing content in countries where such speech was most likely to cause harm, including Ethiopia.

The social media giant said it has ""Invested significant resources in Ethiopia to identify and remove potentially harmful content,"" as part of its response to the board's December recommendations on a case involving content posted in the country.

As Meta had restored the post after the user's appeal to the board, the company had to again remove the content.

On Thursday, Meta said while it had taken the post down, it disagreed with the board's reasoning that it should have been removed because it was an ""Unverified rumor"" that significantly increased the risk of imminent violence.

The board had recommended that Meta commission a human rights due diligence assessment, to be completed in six months, which should include a review of Meta's language capabilities in Ethiopia and a review of measures taken prevent the misuse of its services in the country.

The company said not all elements of this recommendation ""May be feasible in terms of timing, data science or approach.""

Had the word ""Cool"" been a new hot term in recent years, I wouldn't be surprised if Facebook had renamed itself Cool and promised to focus on the ""Coolverse.""

In his piece, titled ""Dopamine, smartphones & you: A battle for your time,"" Haynes indicates Facebook notifications can produce an influx of dopamine in your brain, leaving you wanting more.

To take a sinister point of view, the change of Facebook to Meta makes more sense in this context.

OAKLAND - An embattled Facebook Inc. is changing its name to Meta Platforms Inc., or Meta for short, to reflect what CEO Mark Zuckerberg says is its commitment to developing the new surround-yourself technology known as the ""Metaverse."" But the social network itself will still be called Facebook.

Skeptics immediately accused the company Thursday of trying to change the subject from the Facebook Papers, the trove of leaked documents that have plunged it into the biggest crisis since it was founded in Zuckerberg's Harvard dorm room 17 years ago.

The announcement comes amid heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of Facebook in many parts of the world because of the Facebook Papers.

The Real Facebook Oversight Board, a watchdog group focused on the company, announced that it will keep its name.

""Changing their name doesn't change reality: Facebook is destroying our democracy and is the world's leading peddler of disinformation and hate,"" the group said in a statement.

""Their meaningless name change should not distract from the investigation, regulation and real, independent oversight needed to hold Facebook accountable.""

In explaining the rebrand, Zuckerberg said the name Facebook doesn't encompass everything the company does anymore.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/28/facebook-obscures-its-iconic-like-sign-fueling-speculation-its-rebranding

Facebook owner Meta Platforms FB-Q said on Thursday it would ""Assess the feasibility"" of commissioning an independent human rights assessment into its work in Ethiopia, after its oversight board recommended a review of how Facebook and Instagram have been used to spread content that heightens the risk of violence there.

Meta has been under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over user safety and its handling of abuses on its platforms across the world, particularly after whistle-blower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that showed the company's struggles in policing content in countries where such speech was most likely to cause harm, including Ethiopia.

The social media giant said it has ""Invested significant resources in Ethiopia to identify and remove potentially harmful content,"" as part of its response to the board's December recommendations on a case involving content posted in Ethiopia.

As Meta had restored the post after the user's appeal to the board, the company had to again remove the content.

On Thursday, Meta said while it had taken the post down, it disagreed with the board's reasoning that it should have been removed because it was an ""Unverified rumor"" that significantly increased the risk of imminent violence.

The board had also recommended that Meta commission a human rights due diligence assessment, to be completed in six months, which should include a review of Meta's language capabilities in Ethiopia and a review of measures taken prevent the misuse of its services in the country.

Meta, which has said that it was too slow to prevent misinformation and hate in Myanmar, has said that the company now has native speakers worldwide reviewing content in more than 70 languages which work to stop abuse on its platforms in places where there is a heightened risk of conflict and violence.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/article-facebook-owner-meta-to-assess-the-feasibility-of-human-rights-review/

First, Facebook unveiled a new name - Meta Platforms FB, +0.45% - as part of its project to build the ""Metaverse,"" a virtual world of the sort technologists and science-fiction writers have dreamed of for decades.

One of the most important of these lessons is that Facebook under its current leadership simply cannot be trusted.

The metaverse, in his words, offers a place for everyone with a Facebook headset to ""Do almost anything you can imagine - get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create."" After all, who wouldn't want to ""Feel present"" with their friends, play basketball, or attend more immersive Zoom meetings?

On the other hand, we already have a place to do all these things - it's called ""The world."" In any event, the much-heralded Meta announcement couldn't have come at a better time for Facebook.

Zuckerberg himself announced self-servingly in 2010 that Facebook decided ""The age of privacy is over."" Haugen's allegations seem to have struck a nerve among the public and, critically, among U.S. lawmakers of both parties.

Y aunque es cierto que la ley la va esquivando y que el dinero aún juega a su favor, la verdad es que la crisis de reputación que atraviesa podría ser el principio de su fin.

Y como Zuckerberg lo sabe, ha decidido sacar un enorme conejo blanco de su chistera digital, para asombrarnos con su magia y lograr que dejemos de pedirle cuentas por su ilícito pasado.

Meta no es una palabra que se haya inventado Zuckerberg sino que se usó por primera vez en la novela Snow Crash de Neal Stephenson y hoy es el término con el que visionarios y expertos del mundo digital nombran la tecnología que sucederá a internet.

Hay muchas cosas que desconocemos del futuro virtual, pero sabemos con seguridad que Zuckerberg no será su dueño, igual que Facebook no es el dueño de internet, aunque no deje de intentarlo.

Sin embargo, un posible metaverso no sería una realidad paralela de segunda división -algo que ya conocimos en 2007 con el juego Second Life- sino una extensión real de la propia vida y de la identidad. Parece complicado pero lo cierto es que para entender metaverso no hace falta ser un gurú digital, ni siquiera disponer de unas gafas Oculus: basta con ser un trabajador pospandémico y tener una pizca de imaginación para aplicar sus posibilidades al entorno laboral, por centrarnos en un posible ejemplo.

Y para ser eficaz requerirá que sus habitantes posean algo así como una identidad virtual unificada, exactamente igual que sucede en cualquier ciudad.

0,Facebook's 'metaverse' evolution is very scary - MSNBC News,"Facebook'S 'Metaverse' Evolution Is Very Scary
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Thursday that the company will be rebranding itself as Meta, with a new focus on the ""Metaverse"" and virtual reality products.

All jokes about ""Metadata"" and ""Metastasized harms"" aside, this rebranding move shouldn't take attention away from the very real problems Facebook has failed to fixed.

Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee turned whistleblower, testified at a Senate hearing about what she said were her former company's failures in protecting children and teenagers online.

Regardless of what name it goes by, the company formerly known as Facebook has many problems it must fix.

Imagine a company like Meta choosing to block you from access to a virtual reality space the way that Facebook can block you from using its website and app.

The newly revitalized Federal Trade Commission, led by FTC Chair Lina Khan, should enforce consumer protection and pro-competition laws against Facebook and other large technology companies that are not in compliance with current regulatory standards.

0,The metaverse has a groping problem already - MIT ...,"Sexual assault and harassment in virtual worlds is not new, nor is it realistic to expect a world in which these issues will completely disappear.

The real problem, perhaps, has to do with the perception that when you play a game or participate in a virtual world, there's what Stanton describes as a ""Contract between developer and player."" ""As a player, I'm agreeing to being able to do what I want in the developer's world according to their rules,"" he says.

""We want everyone in Horizon Worlds to have a positive experience with safety tools that are easy to find-and it's never a user's fault if they don't use all the features we offer,"" Meta spokesperson Kristina Milian said.

""We will continue to improve our UI and to better understand how people use our tools so that users are able to report things easily and reliably. Our goal is to make Horizon Worlds safe, and we are committed to doing that work.""

Cross believes it would be useful for training sessions to explicitly lay out norms mirroring those that prevail in ordinary life: ""In the real world, you wouldn't randomly grope someone, and you should carry that over to the virtual world.""

Until we figure out whose job it is to protect users, one major step toward a safer virtual world is disciplining aggressors, who often go scot-free and remain eligible to participate online even after their behavior becomes known.

If anything is clear, it's this: There is no body that's plainly responsible for the rights and safety of those who participate anywhere online, let alone in virtual worlds.",https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/16/1042516/the-metaverse-has-a-groping-problem/

The first iteration, the Meta 1, was funded via Kickstarter, ultimately garnering around $200,000 from supporters.

The company revealed an updated version in 2016, the Meta 2, which sold for $949. It seemed ready to deliver on the company's metaverse aspirations, including deploying AR immersion to improve factory floor worker training, technical design work, and remote communications.

Months later, an investment group secured the assets of Gribetz's failed company and, in a last-ditch effort to revive it, relaunched the effort as Meta View.

Considering Meta's scarred history, some AR industry insiders will find it particularly odd that Zuckerberg is attempting to rehabilitate the Facebook brand by using the same name as a failed metaverse player.

El despliegue de tecnología y posibilidades presentadas en la cita nos transportó a una película de ciencia ficción, quizás buscando dejar atrás los recientes problemas en los que se ha visto Facebook con los llamados ""Facebook Papers"", en la que empresas periodísticas de Estados Unidos y Europa unieron fuerzas para revelar una serie de denuncias en contra de la compañía, a la que, entre otras cosas, acusan de priorizar las ganancias por sobre la seguridad, esfuerzos por ganar mayor audiencia y estar en conocimiento del daño que causan las plataformas a los niños, entre otros.

If the metaverse play succeeds, there may not be any lasting need to respond to challenges such as filtering out fake news and hate speech, limiting data collection, making ad targeting more transparent - all these nasty, intractable, nagging nuisances that the recent release of the ""Facebook Papers"" has confirmed.

Facebook today serves a different purpose than it did a decade ago, and would-be challengers like Snapchat and TikTok aren't well-positioned to threaten the social media platform's dominance with older users.

The metaverse is fine as a side hustle, but in the real world where real people live, Facebook has been causing significant damage.

la fin du mois de septembre, comme je l'ai souligné il y a quelques semaines, l'estimation du BPA des analystes du consensus pour le calendrier 2022 était de 16,12 $. Maintenant, c'est 14,45 $. Il y a eu une réduction similaire de l'estimation consensuelle pour l'année civile 2023.

Qu'est-ce qui a causé le rallye de l'action face la baisse des estimations de bénéfices ? Le coupable le plus évident est le changement de nom de l'entreprise, car - comme je l'ai signalé avant que l'entreprise ne change de nom - le marché réagit généralement favorablement aux changements de nom qui éliminent les références défavorables.

Mais le changement de nom de Facebook aurait-il vraiment pu conduire ce grand rallye face la baisse des estimations de bénéfices ?.

En fait, a-t-il ajouté, cela serait cohérent avec les résultats de ses recherches antérieures si l'action de Meta Platforms continuait battre le marché pendant plusieurs semaines.

Pour le moment, cependant, Meta Platforms a astucieusement changé le récit de la terrible publicité sur l'effet de Facebook sur notre société, et vers l'énorme potentiel du soi-disant métaverse.

In the metaverse of the future, two people could be walking down the same street and see very different things thanks to the AR glasses they're wearing.

Experts told Insider that the metaverse could fracture reality as we know it, allowing advertisers and third parties to give people the personalized worlds they desire and making political polarization even worse.

The kinds of AR technology proposed through this grand metaverse concept, thrust into the limelight recently by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has the potential to transform our lives.

Rosenberg said the risks of the metaverse probably outweigh the good, but it doesn't matter - this new iteration of the internet is inevitable.

As Ethan Zuckerman, who designed one of the first metaverses in the 1990s, wrote in a cautionary piece about Meta's metaverse in The Atlantic last month: ""How will a company that can block only 6 percent of Arabic-language hate content deal with dangerous speech when it's worn on an avatar's T-shirt or revealed at the end of a virtual fireworks display?"".

The independent board that oversees Facebook parent company, Meta, is once again urging the social media giant to be more transparent about its content moderation decisions.

The Facebook Oversight Board on Thursday released two rulings overturning Meta's decisions to remove user posts from its platforms, saying the content did not actually violate the company's policies.

The board asked Facebook to clarify how its actual policies applied to the situation, saying that ""In applying a vague, standardless penalty and then referring this case to the Board to resolve, Facebook seeks to avoid its responsibilities.""

In October, the Oversight Board released its first quarterly transparency report, noting that ""Facebook isn't being clear with the people who use its platforms,"" and calling on the company to give users more information about content decisions.

In its recommendations based on the case, the board said Meta should ""Explain to users precisely what rule in the content policy they have violated,"" when their content is acted upon.

Meta did not notify the user that their post had been restored until a month later, after the board asked about the company's messaging to the user, an issue Meta blamed on human error, the board said.

""Over time, we believe that the combined impact of our recommendations will push Meta to be more transparent and benefit users,"" the board said in the report.",https://wraltechwire.com/2021/12/12/facebook-oversight-board-meta-needs-to-be-more-transparent-in-content-moderation/

A new poll about Facebook's announcement that it changed their name to Meta shows Mark Zuckerberg's decision is not receiving an overwhelming positive response from the American public.

When respondents were asked why they believe Facebook decided to rebrand, 39% believed it was due to poor public perception and 37% thought it was connected to the recent internal leaks/whistleblowing.

""Given how much press the name change and the Facebook Papers are getting, I don't think the change will have much impact on how the company is viewed,"" she said.

Hemphill said Zuckerberg, ""Should start by doing more to address misinformation and toxicity on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and his other properties. The platforms will still exist and operate nearly the same. Changing its name doesn't change its problems.

Christopher Tompkins, the CEO and founder of The Go!

The documents about the internal functioning of Facebook, now Meta, from the cache accessed by whistleblower Frances Haugen, submitted to the US Congress and examined by The Indian Express, outline two sets of voices within the company.

Given the clear social and political harm caused through and, perhaps, by Meta and its products, it is unfortunate that the leadership seems to win the day more often than not.

A host of technical, managerial and political reasons can account for the egregious inaction in Facebook's biggest market: The company lacks the capacity or has not invested in AI and manpower to tackle misinformation in ""Vernacular"" languages; Meta continues to take its ethical responsibility in Western markets more seriously; India lacks both the regulation and political will to clamp down on polarising and false political speech.

For it, concern for the social and political consequences of this drive seems secondary.

Meta's AI needs to factor in ethics and social impact in its operations.

Having said that, a mature constitutional democracy cannot merely place the blame for the erosion in the standards of its political and public conversation on the algorithms of a multinational company.

Mark Zuckerberg had voiced his ambition for Facebook to eventually be known better for its metaverse.

That suggests Zuckerberg has a head start on any other contender looking to secure the ultimate name for a metaverse firm.

The aim of the rebranding would be to reposition Facebook as a metaverse company, The Verge said, with the marquee apps and services like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp likely maintaining their branding under a new parent structure not unlike that practiced by Google and its parent Alphabet Inc. Facebook declined to comment.

Supporting the Meta idea are several factors: Silicon Valley firms favor brief domain names as a mark of prestige, with Alphabet calling abc.xyz home.

Any company named Meta would also be able to lay claim to the term ""Metaverse"" as its own rather than the generic descriptor it currently is.

Facebook noted in a filing that from September ""It became subject to government investigations and requests"" relating to the documents leaked to lawmakers and regulators.

A Washington Post report last month suggested that Facebook's interest in a metaverse virtual world is ""Part of a broader push to rehabilitate the company's reputation with policymakers and reposition Facebook to shape the regulation of next-wave internet technologies.""

Facebook last week announced plans to change its company name to Meta and to create a network of virtual experiences you can access in AR. The company wants you to enter its virtual universe for everything, work and play, and it hopes to make a profit from what you do in that space.

Apple hasn't announced its plans yet, though we do know the company is ""All-in"" on AR and that CEO Tim Cook has high hopes for these technologies.

From what Facebook has told us about its approach, it is more focused on VR than AR, while Apple's approach may turn out to be something wider and more practically useful.

""Changing their name doesn't change reality: Facebook is destroying our democracy and is the world's leading peddler of disinformation and hate,"" the group said in a statement.

""Their meaningless name change should not distract from the investigation, regulation and real, independent oversight needed to hold Facebook accountable.""

Facebook's brand pivot to ""Meta"" last week week is the third inning of a multibillion dollar game of balance sheet roulette.

Facebook's billion-dollar acquisition of Oculus in 2014 more than showed Zuck's hand, though it would be another seven years until the pivot actually happened.

In the years directly after the Oculus acquisition, there was a flurry of investment in VR across the industry.

Hardware platforms from Google, Microsoft, Sony, HTC, Steam and others were announced with great fanfare, though these investments were largely scrapped or defunded a few years later, leaving a dearth of VR hardware platform options.

Taking a developer ecosystem approach through acquisition is a long-play investment to solve the cold-start content problem that all of these VR platforms faced.

If Facebook's acquisition history is a guide, Zuckerberg's strategy will find success, though Facebook's most successful acquisitions, including WhatsApp and Instagram, were already proven social successes at the time they were acquired.

Going all in on the ""Metaverse"" is creating a new platform and paradigm that has been woefully slow to find adoption despite multiple hype cycles over 30 years of excitement.",https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/07/facebooks-meta-existential-pivot-for-survival/

University of Washington computational social scientist Joseph Bak-Coleman explains that Meta's research can be both accurate and misleading.

Despite substantial efforts to track misinformation on social media, it's impossible to know the scope of the problem without knowing the number of overall posts social media users see each day.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at the company's live-streamed virtual and augmented reality conference, said the new name reflected its work investing in the metaverse, rather than its namesake social media service, which will continue to be called Facebook.

In the latest controversy, whistleblower and former Facebook employee Frances Haugen leaked documents which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety.

Facebook said this week that its hardware division Facebook Reality Labs, which is responsible for AR and VR efforts, would become a separate reporting unit and that its investment in it would reduce this year's total operating profit by about $10 billion.

Television host John Stossel sued Facebook and two of its fact-checking partners, Science Feedback and Climate Feedback, earlier this year, accusing the entities of defaming him.

Stossel posted two video reports on Facebook, one of which explored the forest fires devastating California in 2020, including an interview with Michael Shellenberger, a climate change expert.

Stossel said the fact-checking process ""Is nothing more than a pretext used by defendants to defame users with impunity, particularly when defendants disagree with the scientific opinions expressed in user content.""

Meta said its fact-checkers are independent from Facebook and that it is protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

""Beyond this threshold Section 230 problem, the complaint also fails to state a claim for defamation. For one, Stossel fails to plead facts establishing that Meta acted with actual malice-which, as a public figure, he must,"" they wrote.

""For another, Stossel's claims focus on the fact-check articles written by Climate Feedback, not the labels affixed through the Facebook platform. The labels themselves are neither false nor defamatory; to the contrary, they constitute protected opinion. And even if Stossel could attribute Climate Feedback's separate webpages to Meta, the challenged statements on those pages are likewise neither false nor defamatory.

When Xe sought to further shed its skin in 2012, it renamed itself again, this time going by Academi.

Those reincarnations, Facebook would like the whole world to know, are not the examples it is following as, on the eve of Halloween, it puts on a new costume and trashes what it has called itself since 2005, when it sawed the article off The Facebook.

No no, this is much more like Google in 2015 deciding to declare itself much more than just a search engine by rechristening its corporate parent Alphabet.

So Facebook will henceforth be called Meta, and this certainly has nothing to do with the fact that it is hauled before Congress and otherwise called to the carpet to answer a swirl of scandals, including that it disregarded internal research about Instagram's risk to teenagers' mental health; kicked back while poisonous disinformation spread during the last two presidential elections; has done far too little to safeguard users' privacy; and generally, according to a trove of internal documents, used its near-monopoly power to ill effect.

There is a hullaballoo over the renaming of Facebook to Meta by its founder-cum-CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

The Facebook founder also shared a video to provide a glimpse of what the future of the internet will look like.

Hitherto, the Facebook company owned the social media platform Facebook, the photo-sharing app Instagram, the messaging platform WhatsApp and later acquired the GIF platform Giphy.

What's Facebook's reason for changing its name to Meta when the company isn't into chemicals, mining, tobacco or other such controversial industries? The principal reason that drove Zuckerberg to consider the change of name is the company's business model that only seeks growth and even provides space to unscrupulous elements, enabling them to spread visceral hatred and promote violence, as hatred fuels growth according to the social media giant's algorithm.

While Zuckerberg testified before Congress that Facebook deletes 94% of hate speech it finds before a user reports it, the internal findings of the company showed that it was removing less than 5% of all hate speech.

The CMA fined the US-based Facebook £50.5m for breaching an order imposed during its investigation into its acquisition of GIF platform Giphy.

To move beyond my initial reaction and gain more insight into the implications of Facebook's name change from a communication research perspective, I turned to two research fellows who study emerging media within the Communication Research Center at Boston University's College of Communication.

Media psychologist James Cummings, a COM assistant professor of emerging media studies, indicates that a metaverse-if successful-would produce new issues in information processing and would place a new emphasis on theories of interpersonal communication-rather than just mass communication.

Thus, Cummings suggests, if the metaverse is the ecosystem of devices and experiences that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions, users will be switching back and forth between different types of immersive experiences and stimuli, from reality to augmented reality to virtual reality.

Candidates are increasingly relying upon ""Influencers"" to post supportive messages on Facebook and other social media without consistently disclosing they are being paid to do so, blurring the critical line between what is real news and what is merely paid advertising.

For Chris Wells, a COM associate professor of emerging media studies, the promise and pitfalls of the metaverse depend entirely on how Facebook rolls it out.

Are people going to have coffee virtually? Virtual meetings? He suggests that a site such as Second Life may offer rudimentary evidence of the kinds of interactions that emerge when people engage with strangers in a massive virtual world.

Presumably, Wells suggests, Facebook will still have to provide a great deal of content moderation in the metaverse if people are to have any interactions outside tightly defined networks.",https://www.bu.edu/articles/2021/facebook-change-to-meta-blurs-lines/

In an earnings call Monday, Zuckerberg denied the claims of the documents, saying they ""Paint a false picture of our company,"" and that the problems Facebook experiences are a reflection of society.

""Facebook has talented people, and competitors in the market are looking for that talent,"" Holtom says.

""It's extremely competitive. You can be sure companies are preparing to reach out selectively to inquire about people thinking of moving. It's a precarious time for Facebook from a talent perspective.""

In just one measure of the company's employer brand, Facebook's ranking as a top company to work for has slid for several years after claiming the top spot in 2018, according to employee ratings on the review site Glassdoor.

The company on an earnings call Monday already said that Facebook Reality Labs, which encompasses augmented-reality and virtual-reality products and services, is becoming a separate reporting unit and that spending for it would reduce this year's total operating profit by $10 billion.

The metaverse that he has been increasingly promoting also gives him a comfortable topic to focus on as Facebook faces intense criticism from lawmakers, researchers and users over revelations in The Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files series, which showed that the company knows its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm.

At Thursday's event the Facebook chief also addressed the decision to discuss emerging plans while the company faces such scrutiny.

The name change appears to veer away from Facebook's move two years ago to revamp its logo and corporate identity and boost the name's prominence by attaching ""From Facebook"" to the various other brands the company started or acquired over the years.

Facebook critics on Wednesday called on the world's largest social network to release a human rights impact assessment it commissioned in 2020 to investigate hate speech on its platforms in India.

In a letter sent to the company this month and made public on Wednesday, rights groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and India Civil Watch International urged Facebook to release the report.

Gare Smith, partner and chair of global business and human rights practice at the US law firm Foley Hoag, which Facebook commissioned to carry out the assessment, said: ""Such projects are complex, particularly in a country as diverse and large as India.""

Meta's director of human rights policy, Miranda Sissons, said in a statement: ""Given the complexity of this work, we want these assessments to be thorough. We will report annually on how we're addressing human rights impacts, in line with our Human Rights Policy.""

In November, rights groups told The Wall Street Journal that the social media company had narrowed the draft report's scope and was delaying the process.

""As a result of the consistent and continuous barrage of hate on social media, particularly on Facebook, Indian Muslims have been practically dehumanised and rendered helpless and voiceless,"" said Dr Zafarul-Islam Khan, a former Chairman of Delhi Minorities Commission, speaking at a press briefing organised by a group of Facebook critics known as the Real Facebook Oversight Board.

There is simply no question now that the permissive regulatory structure that social media companies operate under has created an unbalanced internet - one that encourages a few powerful companies to thrive off the dissemination of third-party content with little financial or legal responsibility for what that content is or what impact it has on society.

Facebook is built in PHP, compiled with HipHop for PHP, a ""Source code transformer"" built by Facebook engineers that turns PHP into C++. The deployment of HipHop reportedly reduced average CPU consumption on Facebook servers by 50%. Facebook is developed as one monolithic application.

Historically, commentators have offered predictions of Facebook's decline or end, based on causes such as a declining user base; the legal difficulties of being a closed platform, inability to generate revenue, inability to offer user privacy, inability to adapt to mobile platforms, or Facebook ending itself to present a next generation replacement; or Facebook's role in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

In 2018, Facebook took down 536 Facebook pages, 17 Facebook groups, 175 Facebook accounts, and 16 Instagram accounts linked to the Myanmar military.

Early Facebook investor and former Zuckerberg mentor Roger McNamee described Facebook as having ""The most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company."" Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued for transforming Facebook into a platform cooperative owned and governed by the users.

Last week Facebook, the company that owns platforms including Instagram and WhatsApp, made the radical decision to rebrand itself as Meta Platforms, or Meta for short.

A founders letter was sent out on 28 October when the rebranding was announced, with a focus on the idea that the company want to be known for more than the Facebook service.

""I think there are several reasons why Facebook renamed itself as Meta. First, facing numerous allegations on privacy and safety, Facebook is using the new parent name as a distraction to the public to talk about the rebranding despite of whistleblower Frances Haugen's testimonies against Facebook,"" sad Lam.

""Secondly, it helps to placate investors as its stock prices have been declining recently. Having a parent company streamlines operations, which suggests that there could be more transparency and clarity in evaluating its Family of Apps including Facebook and Instagram and Facebook Reality Labs including AR and VR related business segment independently.""

Lam added the name itself is likely reflective of Facebook's desire to grow its reach and ad revenue.

""Lastly, changing its name to a term from a science fiction, 'metaverse' indicates Facebook's commitment to universalizing this way of communication,"" Lam went on to say.

Speaking at the company's Connect virtual reality conference, Zuckerberg said it's time to overhaul the corporation's identity to reflect its broader ambitions.

Seventeen years after Zuckerberg founded Facebook in his Harvard University dorm room, the company's brand has been badly dented by a succession of crises, from Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, which became public in 2018, to last month's damaging revelations from former Facebook employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen.

Once the face recognition system was activated, Facebook would use it to find photos and videos of the user to help them review or share content and ""Suggest tags and provide more relevant content and feature recommendations"", like letting them know if they appear in photos or videos in which they haven't been tagged.

Judge Boasberg threw out the FTC's initial complaint against Facebook over the summer, which sent the agency back to the drawing board.

The FTC alleges Facebook has monopoly power for PSN services, and unlawfully maintained its monopoly by acquiring competitors and potential competitors such as Instagram and WhatsApp.

Judge Boasberg also rejected Facebook's claims that FTC Chair Lina Khan should have recused herself from a vote to refile the lawsuit.

Meta Platforms Inc, the parent company of Facebook, is being sued in the UK for £2.3bn in damages by a competition law hotshot.

I am launching a major class-action claim against Meta for abusing its market dominance for a minimum of £2.3 billion damages on behalf of affected UK Facebook users.

""By exploiting users' data, both within the Facebook platform and off-platform through mechanisms like the Facebook Pixel, the company was able to build very detailed pictures of users' internet usage.

The class-action suit will argue that while access to Facebook is ostensibly free to its UK users, the ""Price"" set for gaining access to the social network was the surrender of UK users' highly valuable personal data on a take it or leave it basis for using the network.

""Facebook's deception of users allowed Facebook to prevent sophisticated rivals, like Google, from entering the market.""

Koh, writing for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, used several statements by founder Mark Zuckerberg against the company, saying they suggested that he and other top executives knew robust competition would force Facebook to rein in its data harvesting.

No errors found The Lead Stories article, though it failed to identify any errors in The BMJ's investigation, nevertheless carried the title, ""Fact Check: The British Medical Journal Did NOT Reveal Disqualifying and Ignored Reports of Flaws in Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Trials."" The first paragraph wrongly described The BMJ as a ""News blog"" and was accompanied by a screenshot of the investigation article with a stamp over it stating ""Flaws Reviewed,"" despite the Lead Stories article not identifying anything false or inaccurate.

O95 Miller defended his article, noting, ""We did not call into question the integrity of The BMJ's story, only the comprehensiveness of it. That's the point of a 'Missing Context' rating.""We couldn't agree more with you the public should be concerned, provided they have all the context, which is what we attempted to point out and, in some small way, provide as a supplement to The BMJ's report.

"" In a subsequent email, Alan Duke, editor in chief of Lead Stories, told The BMJ that the ""Missing Context"" label was created by Facebook specifically ""to deal with content that could mislead without additional context but which was otherwise true or real.

The BMJ plans to appeal to Facebook's Oversight Board, an independent panel of 20 people from around the world that can decide whether Facebook should allow or remove specific content.

The 2017 purchase of meta.org, a biomedical research tool that analyses and connects millions of scientific outputs was the first step towards a shift in the Facebook Inc. brand.

Following the announcement of the Meta company, meta.org now has a header that reads: ""Meta.org will sunset March 31, 2022: Meta will be supported through March 31, 2022. In the lead up, we will work with you in transitioning to alternative open services.""

Although shutting five years earlier than initially proposed, the 2017 acquisition can harmonise with meta.com, the official website of the Meta company, without conflicts in terms of identity, as meta.org's current function differs from Zuckerberg's new parent company.

On Thursday, Zuckerberg announced the formation of Meta amid claims that the Facebook algorithm exposes users' private data to manipulation.
