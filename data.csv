Amid privacy scandals and controversy, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed.

Facebook, now under Meta, is undergoing a serious rebranding - most noticeably the incorporation of a future ""Metaverse."" This Metaverse includes spaces to work, collaborate and interact with others as well as a gaming platform reminiscent of Microsoft's failed.

It is clear that Zuckerberg is aware of the disdain people have toward the privacy violations of Facebook - throughout the video, he emphasizes the importance of ensuring privacy from the early stages of the Metaverse.

Zuckerberg's rebranding of Facebook could be an attempt to hide the baggage which comes with the name.

""As long as Facebook is operating in the shadows, hiding its research from public scrutiny, it is unaccountable. Until the incentives change, Facebook will not change,"" Facebook's whistleblower Frances Haugen stated.

Zuckerberg argues the Meta platform is designed for a distant future, but professional mockups make the usability of the software look clunky and awkward.

The question is if Zuckerberg's attempt to distract from Facebook's many affairs will be effective in keeping Facebook as unregulated as it is now.",https://dailyillini.com/opinions-stories/2021/11/18/meta-facebook-launch/

You have to hand it to Mark Zuckerberg: He certainly doesn't shy away from embarrassing himself - witness his cringeworthy video announcement to rebrand Facebook as Meta.

If we're being kind, Zuckerberg's show could be considered an ambitious vision if it wasn't for the fact that the company currently has enough problems on its hands that neither a new name nor virtual reality can solve.

For weeks, media outlets have been publishing internal documents under the name ""Facebook Papers,"" many of which originated with former company employee-turned-whistleblower Frances Haugen.

These documents reveal a world that has nothing whatsoever to do with Zuckerberg's cozy visions.

Facebook does far too little to curb hate speech and conspiracy narratives.

Zuckerberg's calculation is that the overall corporation will garner a better image if Facebook is just a part of the whole.

Last week, Facebook Inc. announced its new corporate name, Meta, along with a new logo as part of the company's strategic shift toward focusing on the metaverse.

The public's initial reaction to the rebrand is less than enthusiastic, according to new data from Morning Consult.

A plurality of Americans said they have an unfavorable opinion of the new name.

Meta's new logo received a slightly less chilly reception, with respondents more evenly split on the warped infinity symbol.

That the new corporate name is meant to better ""Reflect who we are and the future we hope to build,"" a reference to his aspirations of building a metaverse, which he describes as ""An embodied internet where you're in the experience, not just looking at it.""

0,The expert's view- Facebook's move to Meta - 2021 - Articles,"Transform Magazine: The Expert'S View- Facebook'S Move To Meta
At the annual Facebook Connect conference, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook group's official rebrand to Meta, which will focus on bringing the metaverse to life and help people connect.

""That said, the execution of his vision has already fallen somewhat flat. An opportunity to be distinctive has been lost in the desire to retain links to Facebook through a similar colour palette, whilst the typography is reminiscent of early 2000s phone companies and feels a little generic. Of course, the rebrand also comes at a pivotal time for the company, currently embattled by increasing scrutiny from Congress. As a move to shift focus away from the ills of Facebook of old, the rebrand has its work cut out for it - and, on first review, it may struggle to live up to the task.""

""Facebook's rebrand to Meta signals a move to simultaneously overcome its current struggles and define a new growth opportunity. The shifting of its focus towards the metaverse and goal to make AR and VR-enabled experiences part of""the next generation of online social experiences"" has been well publicised and is indicative of how digital experience is evolving and touching more of our everyday lives"".

""The renaming of Facebook's parent company to Meta changes nothing for them, especially not the public perception of Facebook as a force for chaos, misinformation, and privacy violation. Mark Zuckerberg, a simulacrum of a human being, proposes that we will join his online environment called the""metaverse"", presumably as an escape from the dystopian society that Facebook has helped create.

""While it would be easy to see this recent move from Facebook as a smoke screen to throw people off negative press, it's short-sighted to look at the launch of Meta through such a one dimensional lens. A rebrand fools no-one when you are dealing with a crisis and Facebook will know this.""

The reality is that this move has been on the cards for a very long time as Facebook transitions its focus from platform to medium.

Alex Marshall, director of creative and strategy, Starts With A. ""Whilst the new name has already been widely ridiculed, this will likely be a successful move for Facebook. Zuckerberg has a clear vision and the Facebook name will constrain these ambitions. It makes commercial sense and already the share price has increased as a result. By moving to Meta, a clear and strong identity, the company can travel in the direction of the future platforms it wants to build. Yes, this might be another Google/Alphabet, but the strategy and reasoning behind this rebrand is much stronger. By 2031 I doubt that Gen Alpha will even be aware that Facebook used to be the parent brand.""",https://www.transformmagazine.net/articles/2021/the-experts-view-facebooks-move-to-meta/

The metaverse is not yet a reality, but it could be the next evolution of the internet.

If you're interested in technology, you've probably heard the buzzword of the moment - ""Metaverse."" The hype around this term may have reached its zenith Thursday, when Facebook announced that it was renaming its portfolio of companies 'Meta' to align its businesses with its ambition to build the metaverse.

The metaverse doesn't exist - at least not yet.

Just as you can't invest in the internet too, can you not identify the metaverse as a unique product, technology or service.

Central to the concept of the metaverse is the idea that virtual, 3D environments that are accessible and interactive in real time will become the transformative medium for social and business engagement.

The metaverse is also expected to have a strong connection with the real-world economy - and eventually become an extension of it.

Indiana University's Filippo Menczer, who studies the spread of information and misinformation in social networks, explains that engagement plays into people's tendency to favor posts that seem popular.

Some of the most disturbing revelations concern the harm Meta's Instagram social media platform causes adolescents, particularly teen girls.

The company has provided research that shows that its platforms do not cause harm in the way many researchers describe, and claims that the overall picture from all research on harm is unclear.

Despite substantial efforts to track misinformation on social media, it's impossible to know the scope of the problem without knowing the number of overall posts social media users see each day.

A federal judge says the US Federal Trade Commission can proceed with an antitrust lawsuit against Meta, formerly known as Facebook, after dismissing the suit last year.

District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg said in an opinion released today that the FTC's first complaint had ""Stumbled out of the starting blocks."" But a revised version, Boasberg said, makes the same arguments with facts that are ""Far more robust and detailed than before."" As a result, he's denying Meta's motion to dismiss and allowing the case to proceed, although he states that the agency ""May well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations.""

Throughout the case, the FTC has alleged that Meta holds an unlawful monopoly in personal social networking services and maintained it by acquiring the competitors Instagram and WhatsApp.

Today's opinion says the agency has reasonably backed that allegation up with data about Meta's market power, although like before, Boasberg held back on approving allegations involving older Meta interoperability policies.

The FTC suit against Meta is one of several US government efforts to curtail the monopoly power of major tech companies, including a Department of Justice lawsuit against Google proceeding under antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter.

Today's decision reverses a significant blow that Boasberg dealt the FTC in June, when he said the complaint contained ""Nothing"" proving Meta's monopoly power except for the ""Naked allegation"" that it held a dominant share of personal social networking services.

Facebook owner Meta Platforms said on Thursday it would ""Assess the feasibility"" of commissioning an independent human rights assessment into its work in Ethiopia, after its oversight board recommended a review of how Facebook and Instagram have been used to spread content that heightens the risk of violence there.

Meta has been under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over user safety and its handling of abuses on its platforms across the world, particularly after whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that showed the company's struggles in policing content in countries where such speech was most likely to cause harm, including Ethiopia.

The social media giant said it has ""Invested significant resources in Ethiopia to identify and remove potentially harmful content,"" as part of its response to the board's December recommendations on a case involving content posted in the country.

As Meta had restored the post after the user's appeal to the board, the company had to again remove the content.

On Thursday, Meta said while it had taken the post down, it disagreed with the board's reasoning that it should have been removed because it was an ""Unverified rumor"" that significantly increased the risk of imminent violence.

The board had recommended that Meta commission a human rights due diligence assessment, to be completed in six months, which should include a review of Meta's language capabilities in Ethiopia and a review of measures taken prevent the misuse of its services in the country.

The company said not all elements of this recommendation ""May be feasible in terms of timing, data science or approach.""

Had the word ""Cool"" been a new hot term in recent years, I wouldn't be surprised if Facebook had renamed itself Cool and promised to focus on the ""Coolverse.""

In his piece, titled ""Dopamine, smartphones & you: A battle for your time,"" Haynes indicates Facebook notifications can produce an influx of dopamine in your brain, leaving you wanting more.

To take a sinister point of view, the change of Facebook to Meta makes more sense in this context.

I have wanted to leave Facebook for years, but that dopamine feedback loop is difficult to resist.","https://sbj.net/stories/opinion-facebook-has-killed-the-word-meta,76993"

OAKLAND - An embattled Facebook Inc. is changing its name to Meta Platforms Inc., or Meta for short, to reflect what CEO Mark Zuckerberg says is its commitment to developing the new surround-yourself technology known as the ""Metaverse."" But the social network itself will still be called Facebook.

Skeptics immediately accused the company Thursday of trying to change the subject from the Facebook Papers, the trove of leaked documents that have plunged it into the biggest crisis since it was founded in Zuckerberg's Harvard dorm room 17 years ago.

The announcement comes amid heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of Facebook in many parts of the world because of the Facebook Papers.

The Real Facebook Oversight Board, a watchdog group focused on the company, announced that it will keep its name.

""Changing their name doesn't change reality: Facebook is destroying our democracy and is the world's leading peddler of disinformation and hate,"" the group said in a statement.

""Their meaningless name change should not distract from the investigation, regulation and real, independent oversight needed to hold Facebook accountable.""

In explaining the rebrand, Zuckerberg said the name Facebook doesn't encompass everything the company does anymore.",https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/10/28/facebook-obscures-its-iconic-like-sign-fueling-speculation-its-rebranding

Facebook owner Meta Platforms FB-Q said on Thursday it would ""Assess the feasibility"" of commissioning an independent human rights assessment into its work in Ethiopia, after its oversight board recommended a review of how Facebook and Instagram have been used to spread content that heightens the risk of violence there.

Meta has been under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over user safety and its handling of abuses on its platforms across the world, particularly after whistle-blower Frances Haugen leaked internal documents that showed the company's struggles in policing content in countries where such speech was most likely to cause harm, including Ethiopia.

The social media giant said it has ""Invested significant resources in Ethiopia to identify and remove potentially harmful content,"" as part of its response to the board's December recommendations on a case involving content posted in Ethiopia.

As Meta had restored the post after the user's appeal to the board, the company had to again remove the content.

On Thursday, Meta said while it had taken the post down, it disagreed with the board's reasoning that it should have been removed because it was an ""Unverified rumor"" that significantly increased the risk of imminent violence.

The board had also recommended that Meta commission a human rights due diligence assessment, to be completed in six months, which should include a review of Meta's language capabilities in Ethiopia and a review of measures taken prevent the misuse of its services in the country.

Meta, which has said that it was too slow to prevent misinformation and hate in Myanmar, has said that the company now has native speakers worldwide reviewing content in more than 70 languages which work to stop abuse on its platforms in places where there is a heightened risk of conflict and violence.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/international-business/article-facebook-owner-meta-to-assess-the-feasibility-of-human-rights-review/
0,Facebook can change its name to Meta Platforms or anything ...,"Opinion: Facebook Can Change Its Name To Meta Platforms Or Anything Else, But Its Current Leadership Cannot Be Trusted
First, Facebook unveiled a new name - Meta Platforms FB, +0.45% - as part of its project to build the ""Metaverse,"" a virtual world of the sort technologists and science-fiction writers have dreamed of for decades.

One of the most important of these lessons is that Facebook under its current leadership simply cannot be trusted.

The metaverse, in his words, offers a place for everyone with a Facebook headset to ""Do almost anything you can imagine - get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create."" After all, who wouldn't want to ""Feel present"" with their friends, play basketball, or attend more immersive Zoom meetings?

On the other hand, we already have a place to do all these things - it's called ""The world."" In any event, the much-heralded Meta announcement couldn't have come at a better time for Facebook.

Zuckerberg himself announced self-servingly in 2010 that Facebook decided ""The age of privacy is over."" Haugen's allegations seem to have struck a nerve among the public and, critically, among U.S. lawmakers of both parties.

Facebook is a powerful data company with a frankly appalling record on privacy.

Privacy enables so many things that we care about, even if it makes it harder for companies like Facebook to serve personalized and surveillance-based ads.",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-can-change-its-name-to-meta-platforms-or-anything-else-but-its-current-leadership-cannot-be-trusted-11640129484
